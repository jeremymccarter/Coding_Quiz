# Coding_Quiz
A short, timed quiz that covers some basics of JavaScript.

The quiz includes a start page, with a view highscore button in the corner that will take you
to previous highscores. When taking the quiz, you'll have 30 seconds to answer the questions.
If a question is answered incorrectly, 5 seconds will be removed from the timer. After completion,
an input for entering your high score will appear, which will then log the high scores. You can clear
the high scores with a button and or return to the start to do it again.
